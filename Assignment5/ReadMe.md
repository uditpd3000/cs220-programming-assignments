## Q-1

## 8-bit GCD Calculator

Two 8-bit numbers are given as input as u and v.

Module gcd uses binary gcd algorithm to calculate the gcd

we are using loop to check the conditions of the algorithm.

x and y are two 8-bit registers which we have used to do the calculations

Finally we have stored the result in outp register

## Question 2

## Insertion Sort:

We have implemented Insertion Sort in MIPS Assembly Language.
An array of size 10 is taken as input in loop0 and insertion sort is done where loop1 and loop2 signifies the outer loop and inner loop of insertion sort respectively. Finally, the sorted array is printed.

## Question 3

## Fibonacci Series

We have implemented Fibonacci Series in MIPS Assembly Language where we have printed fibonacci numbers upto 500.

## Question 4

## Floating Point Vector

We have implemented Single Precision Floating Point Vector in MIPS Assembly Language where we have printed the required summation of the input floating point numbers. Inputs are taken as floating point numbers in array arr
